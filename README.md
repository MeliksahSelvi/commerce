# Commerce project!

This project created to be learning Hexagonal Architecture, Event Driven Messaging, CQRS Pattern, Saga Pattern, Outbox Pattern. 
At the meantime I will add unit and integration tests at end of the project. 
I think trying to Java 21/22 features such as Virtual Thread, String Templates, Record For Pattern Matching etc on this project.

In the other hand, I will have increasing my knowledge of clean code and refactoring code. 
This project will be the biggest project of my own projects. This adventure will improve me by all aspects of software engineering.

<li>Spring Boot 3.2.3</li>
